Current models working on : 

PREDICT ANIMATE vs INANIMATE: 
basic feature selection (mean, min, max, var, skew, kurtosis) on each channel
    NOTES: on the new data, number of animate/inanimate trials is skewed so that a constant model could get 0.58 accuracy
    
    See basic_feature_extraction notebook for where this comes from
    no averaging
        LinearSVC
            train error 0.37
            test error 0.45 -- accuracy is 0.55 +/- 0.02
        Random Forest
            train error 0
            test error 0.44 -- accuracy is 0.56 +/- 0.04
        RBF SVC
            train error 0.38
            test error 0.42 -- arruacy is 0.58 +/- 0.02
            
     overall -- none are competetent at tackling this problem.
     Steps forward
         - extract the features accross windows (200-400ms, 400-600, etc)         
         - extract other features
         - optimize parameters
         
    with averaging
        not currently working on
        
no feature selection: 
    not currently working on
    
    Steps forward
        - larger grid parameter search on SVM (very time consuming)
        
PREDICT AGE: 
Since we aren't getting any results predicting animate vs inanimate, I'm starting to spend some time predicting age of candidates.
This will provide a sanity check that something wrong isn't happening earlier, as well as give us some insight as to which models
can perform well on this data.

On the last batch of data/data cleaning, linear SVMs with basic feature extraction (min max avg skew kurtosis) was able to significantly
(but still with low-ish accuracy) distinguish between age groups. On the new batch suddenly that accuracy has dropped. I'm reporting new
stats here. Notebooks are "basic_feature_extraction -- predict age" and "no feature extraction -- predict age"


Note there are 63% older kids, we want >> that 63% accuracy mark for it to be noteworthy
	feature extraction accuracies:
